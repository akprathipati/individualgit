### College Board Notes
## CollegeBoard Notes: [Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AIvtYBSqMLNqruzeudRC560-xHbVl7lelLFy1LClEEY/edit)
## AP Classroom FRQ: [pdf document](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam/past-exam-questions)

### Study 
- I will review all my notes and work on the practice FRQ's seen above. 
- I need to spent some time looking at the different types of data structures (like hashmaps, tuples, and arrays) and saw if they were primitive or non-primitive types.
- I need to work on datastructes and data types as well. 

### TT notes(data structures)
- matrixes
- Sort algo
Merge sort is one of the most flexible sorting algorithms in java known to mankind (yes, no kidding). It uses the divide and conquers strategy for sorting elements in an array. It is also a stable sort, meaning that it will not change the order of the original elements in an array concerning each other. The underlying strategy breaks up the array into multiple smaller segments till segments of only two elements (or one element) are obtained. Now, elements in these segments are sorted and the segments are merged to form larger segments. This process continues till the entire array is sorted.

Heap sort is one of the most important sorting methods in java that one needs to learn to get into sorting. It combines the concepts of a tree as well as sorting, properly reinforcing the use of concepts from both. A heap is a complete binary search tree where items are stored in a special order depending on the requirement. A min-heap contains the minimum element at the root, and every child of the root must be greater than the root itself. The children at the level after that must be greater than these children, and so on. Similarly, a max-heap contains the maximum element at the root. For the sorting process, the heap is stored as an array where for every parent node at the index i, the left child is at index 2 * i + 1, and the right child is at index 2 * i + 2.

 Imperative vs. Object Oriented Paradigms

Imperative Paradigms are more step-by-step than Object Oriented Paradigms. OOP relies on classes and objects, although the methods have Imperative Paradigms.

Java Arrays

public static Animal[] animalData() {
	return new Animal[]{
	        new Animal("Lion", 8, "Gold"),
	        new Animal("Pig", 3, "Pink"),
		new Animal("Robin", 7, "Red"),
		new Animal("Cat", 10, "Black"),
		new Animal("Kitty", 1, "Calico"),
		new Animal("Dog", 14, "Brown")
	};
}
Java Dictionaries

private final Map<String, Integer> OPERATORS = new HashMap<>();
    {
        // Map<"token", precedence>
        OPERATORS.put("*", 3);
        OPERATORS.put("/", 3);
        OPERATORS.put("%", 3);
        OPERATORS.put("+", 4);
        OPERATORS.put("-", 4);
    }

DEF: linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memor
 
DEF:T> specifically stands for generic type. According to Java Docs - A generic type is a generic class or interface that is parameterized over types.
