O(l) - constant time
This means that the algorithm requires the same fixed number of steps regardless of the size. 
O(n) - linear time
This means that the algorithm requires a number of steps proportional to the size of the task.
If a task is more complex, then it will require more time overall. 
The purpose of Big O notation is to calculate the time it 
p(n) = aknk + ak-1nk-1 + ... + a1n + a0
One way to calculate it, we can use a series method. 

Constant naoiton is the best way.
