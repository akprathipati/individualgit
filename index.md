All numbers move to their respective places bit by bit, left to right, like bubbles slowly rising from a body of water.

If you'd like to read a detailed, dedicated article for Bubble Sort, we've got you covered!
Implementation

We're going to implement Bubble Sort in a similar way we've laid it out in words. Our function enters a while loop in which it goes through the entire array swapping as needed.

We assume the array is sorted, but if we're proven wrong while sorting (if a swap happens), we go through another iteration. The while-loop then keeps going until we manage to pass through the entire array without swapping:



For example, if I had used a[i] >= a[i+1] it could have ended up with an infinite loop, because for equal elements this relation would always be true, and hence always swap them.
